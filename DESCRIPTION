Description: It provides a set of S4 classes for different gene types (e.g., protein-coding gene,
    long non-coding RNA gene, microRNA gene, ...) which are inherited from a virtual gene class
    that represents genes in general. Each gene should contain information about its ID
    (e.g., Ensembl ID or NCBI gene ID), HUGO symbol, gene name, description, gene structure
    (chromosome, start, end, strand, exons, e.g., as GRanges object) and gene product(s) 
    (e.g., protein ID, protein sequence, lncRNA ID, RNA sequence, microRNA ID, microRNA seed 
    sequence, etc.). Think about what information is generic and applicable to all genes and 
    what information is meaningful only for specific gene types. Provide constructor functions 
    and where appropriate accessor functions, e.g., "symbol(gene)" for both getting and setting 
    the symbol information of a gene object, such that the user does not need to directly access 
    data slots (e.g., with "gene@symbol"). Provide a class-specific function "lengthProduct(gene)" 
    which returns the length of the product of a specific gene object (e.g., length of the encoded 
    protein for a protein-coding gene, length of the RNA for an lncRNA gene, length of the final 
    miRNA for a microRNA gene, etc.). This package is designed to be compatible with Bioconductor standards.
